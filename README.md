## Context

QBD Group provides Authorized Representative services:
- **EC-REP** (EU) - European Authorized Representative
- **CH-REP** (Switzerland) - Swiss Authorized Representative
- **UKRP** (UK) - UK Responsible Person

These services enable medical device manufacturers to access European, Swiss, and UK markets.

## Key Decision

**Extend IFUcare vs Build New vs Buy**

QBD already operates the IFUcare platform for electronic Instructions For Use (eIFU). A key consideration is whether to extend this existing platform or pursue an alternative approach.
